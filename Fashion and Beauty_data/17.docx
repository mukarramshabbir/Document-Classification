 My Ode to The YouTubers  I, myself, felt taken aback when I realized that I loved fashion and beauty. This life-change happened during early Covid of 2020, when I was in a delirium of chatting my friends about the dark Tiger King world and doing weird workouts next to my laundry rack while my 5 roommates slowly became sick of each other in confinement. I was in my final year of school, and things were hard. I was struggling with the 2020 job market, wondering if I should go to grad schools that I got into just to ride out the pandemic even though I didn’t have much interest in the programs (I decided against them), and struggling with my weight, acne, and a multitude of personal problems. But one day, a friend and I took a drive around the city. We barreled down the empty freeways, looked at the apocalyptic empty streets, and chatted about life. She told me about one of her favorite beauty and lifestyle YouTubers, and how much this YouTuber had helped her with her own life. I got home and thought about our conversation. I had been raised with that feminism that stated that girls can do anything that boys can do (I’m cool with that), and that it’s much better if the girl does everything that is male coded (I dislike this one). And that if the girl DOES do girly things, it’s kind of a defect but she can do her little girly things on the side if she just HAS to (I really have a problem with this one). Fashion is superfluous, but fiiiiiiine, if some woman is successful in her career and wants to spend on bobbles and notions, we’ll look away. Just don’t make it pink things, please. On top of this feminism, I was raised in a frugal family. My brothers and I all shared the same harsh face wash (with no moisturizers or sun screens, since those were expensive and none of us knew the importance of skin hydration and sun safety). I certainly never had the money to spend on fashion trends that came and went. Plus, my family regarded fashion with utter disdain. Frankly, I can understand it: fashion takes up a lot of money and resources. None of them were raised in families with much disposable income, and clothes were a means to an end: to not get arrested for public nudity and to get some basic social respect. Practically speaking, clothes do not obviously contribute to life in the way that something like a baseball bat or basketball hoop does. With sports items, the user can do new activities. But what exactly do beauty routines and clothes get you, besides an empty wallet? I went about 22 years thinking the above. I truly thought that fashion was only ever pointless and wasteful, and thought that skin care was just a scam by lotion companies. But, after this conversation with my friend, I entered a whole new era. That evening, I Googled and YouTubed the HECK out of beauty routines. I found Hyram, James Welsh, Nicolas Fairford, Jennifer Chiu, Leah Yoo, and so, so many more. I had struggled with acne since the beginning of university. Through my YouTuber binge-watching sessions, I learned the science (from my scientific YouTubers) of nutrition, skin care, and skin health. And while I still, admittedly, think a lot of expensive and wild skin care is a bit of a scam, a healthy and affordable skincare routine makes a HUGE difference in over-all skin health. Things like gently cleansing morning and night, using appropriate serums, and always wearing sunscreen and moisturizers are absolutely key. While I do not need $300 skin serums every month (maybe they do help, but I am still skeptical), I can take care of myself in an affordable way. I also learned about nutrition from dieticians and nutritionists on YouTube and TikTok. In college, I had gained about 20 pounds since starting. I did not understand why for four years, and came to realize that I simply did not have the health and nutrition understanding to eat and be healthy. I had operated for years on the premise that losing weight is simple: calories in, calories out. BUT, I failed to realize that the nutritional density and food density play a major factor. For years, I would try and eat at 1200 calories per day, like MyFitnessPal said to do based on my body. Nevermind that I now know that limit to be too low for me, I also did not realize that my plan to eat half of my daily calorie goal in sugary foods like cookies would leave me starving and miserable. I also did not realize that a salad with dressing, leafy greens, chicken, beans, and so much else counted as a full meal. For years, due to living in a wildly anti-salad household (it is funny now), I thought salads were meaningless and devoid of calories. But, thanks to YouTube, I learned that eating half my diet in sugar is unhealthy. Also, YouTube taught me that a full salad can easily be 600 calories of nutrient-dense, healthy foods. YouTube taught me about nutrition, sustainable eating habits, and that eating vegetables does NOT negate the health impacts of a high-sugar diet. I started to eat healthier, and over the last two years, my relationship with food has turned much more healthy. Thank you, YouTube. In this same time period that I was developing my absolute love for skin care and nutrition, I found my love of fashion. During my poking around social media, I initially shunned the fashion YouTubers. I thought of them as wasteful and ridiculous. Until, one day, I clicked. In this YouTuber’s content, I found a whole new world. The fashion world I found was about putting your best self forward, being excited for your day, and being realistic that we live in a world where looks and impressions do count. Instead of throwing up arms and wishing we lived in a kinder world, these YouTubers gave real tips of how to look your best and use it to gain respect and to do the things that you want to do. After all, other people are the ones who are at the door of each new opportunity. If you look respectable and as if you respect yourself by taking care of yourself, they are much more likely to take you seriously. Rather than fashion being about getting people to have sex with you or making friends jealous, I found a world that aligned with some of my more pragmatic values. I realized that style and self-care is a signal to other people that you care about yourself. Nothing needs to be fancy or expensive, but if you don’t meet the bar of respect of your local community (the bar changes dramatically), then you’re at risk of not being taken seriously or have people feel antsy around you since you’re not the norm. And all the caveats need to fly in here: yes, it does cost money to do self-care- it’s not free. Does it have to be wildly expensive? No. But does it take most notably having a safe place to retreat to and some basic resources? Yes. So is it accessible to every single person in every single situation? No. Along with the caveats here are what learning about self-care did for me. I graduated in Covid, and had some big decisions to make. In Covid, I both learned about taking care of myself and realized that I was NOT okay with an extremely low-paid job in exchange for doing my “passion” (which I had recently realized was not at all my “passion” but just something I did out of guilt). I realized that I wanted a job and career path that would make me more money. I realized that I wanted to build myself a life outside of work where I COULD take money and spend it on skincare, clothes, and giving myself relaxing time. I realized that all of that takes a lot of money and space. I also realized that I care deeply about giving myself a wonderful life outside of work, and living in a safe (relatively) area. All of that takes money and requires certain types of jobs. My career path altered dramatically after watching these YouTubers. I said no to the graduate schools that I realized only lead to tenuous unpaid internships, low-paid entry-level jobs, and unending debt and a lack of money to spend on a personal life. I looked for jobs that paid higher, and altered how I chose my living situations. I do NOT believe in spending tons of money on products and clothes, and I do know that skincare and fashion are highly resource-intensive. Plus, much of the fashion world is darkened by labor issues including human trafficking. So, I believe in buying quality and few items, and really researching the heck out of any fashion and beauty purchase. I do not feel entitled to nice clothes, but rather see them as useful tools that I need to buy strategically. I had some major challenges and errors along the way. I am learning, and always will be. Thank you, YouTubers, for dramatically altering my standards and goals for my (not the) better :)
