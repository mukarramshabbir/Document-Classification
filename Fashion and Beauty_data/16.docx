 The Most Insane Wearables & Tech From CES 2024 AI, AR, Wearables, Fashion and Beauty Tech Remember when the first FitBit came out? It was 2009 and it clipped into your pocket and could track 3 metrics: steps taken, distance traveled, and (estimated) calories burned. The First Fitbit. Source: IEEE.ORG CES 2024 has shown just us how far we’ve come from just counting steps or tracking heart rates. From the integration of fashion and tech to incredible developments in wearables, CES 2024 showcased a vision for the future. What’s CES? If you’ve never heard of CES, or the Consumer Electronics Show, it’s an annual event held in Las Vegas where the world’s most prominent tech companies and startups come together to showcase the latest in consumer electronics. CES Logo from CES Media Kit From new gadgets to futuristic cars (yes, there are flying cars now!) to advancements in AI, AR, and sustainable technology, CES is one massive conference that’s a melting pot of ideas. In short, it’s a time when tech enthusiasts like myself get to geek out over all of the new consumer products. This year, I’m interested in the realms that fuse technology with our daily lives in the most intimate of ways- I’m talking fashion, retail, and beauty tech. It’s in these sectors that technology meets aesthetics & functionality blends with style. From smart wearables to AI-powered beauty tools, technology is not just changing the way we live but the way we look and the way we shop! The first Fitbit from only 15 years ago feels primitive compared to new sleek wearables that seamlessly blend with our style while enhancing our day-to-day experiences. With more AI-powered wearables launching, we move towards a future where our gadgets are not just tools but extensions of ourselves. As someone who is deeply passionate about how tech transforms our daily lives, I’m excited to share some of the products and trends that caught my eye at CES 2024. Standout Products Photo: ASUS Who needs dual monitors?! The new ASUS AirVision M1 Smart Glasses offer a multi-monitor experience in a sleek, fashion-forward design. You have the freedom of working everywhere with a private, personal display- this could be a game-changer for professionals on the go! Photo: Amazfit The Amazfit Helio Ring by Zepp Health isn’t just another fitness tracker; it’s a comprehensive wellness tool. Not only does it measure your physical activity, it also measures your mental well-being, giving you a ‘Readiness’ score. This holistic approach to health monitoring represents a significant leap in how we perceive and interact with wearables. Photo: Evolve MVMT The Evolve MVMT wearable focuses on the quality of each step you take to reduce joint stress. The wearable looks at your gait biometrics (gait: your walking pattern) and analyzes how your heel strikes the ground. The MVMT uses ‘light walking’ for less heel striking, a common issue leading to joint injuries. TREND: Wearable Tech’s Leap into Mental Health In the realm of wearable tech, startups are now venturing into the essential territory of mental well-being. The idea of wearables being able to actively manage mental health is astounding and inspiring. As a big mental health advocate, my journey has taken me from championing the cause online to speaking in schools. The potential of these technologies fills me with optimism. It’s a step towards empowering people in their relationship with themselves, offering tools to make self-care and mental health management more accessible and effective. Photo: apolloneuro.com The Apollo Neuro is an innovative wearable that is designed to help manage stress by using gentle vibrations to stimulate the nervous system. It’s designed to enhance overall well-being through optimized heart rate variability (HRV) and stress management. Users have reported better sleep, improved focus, and more! Photo: NOWATCH NOWATCH is a smartwatch that’s focused on stress tracking and mindfulness. The wearable has an accompanying app that allows the user to track physiological data and learn tools to balance their nervous system. Photo: Baracoda The BMind Smart Mirror, a 2024 CES innovation award winner, introduces a novel approach to mental health. The AI-powered smart mirror uses generative AI and natural language processing to detect your mood and suggest exercises like guided meditation or self-affirmations. It’s a leap from seeing our reflection to interacting with it in a way that improves our mental state. NuraLogix also won an innovation award in Digital Health with The Anura Magic Mirror which is a mirror that analyzes facial blood flow and can assess vital signs and health risks in just 30 seconds. TREND: Women-Focused Wearables In a world where technology is always evolving, CES showed that it’s also becoming more inclusive and tailored to women’s needs (about time!). Three innovations designed with women in mind: Photo: Garmin The Garmin Lily 2 Smartwatch is more than a fitness tracker — it’s a comprehensive health monitor. It tracks everything from heart rate to stress levels, offering insights that go beyond physical fitness to encompass overall well-being. My favorite part of this watch is that it marries fashion with functionality - a wearable that truly understands women’s lifestyles! Photo: Garmin For women who find traditional chest straps uncomfortable or impractical, the Garmin HRM-Fit Chest Strap is designed to be compatible with your sports bra! It’s a comfortable and accurate way to monitor your heart rate that’s compatible with your unique and diverse fitness needs. Photo: Evie Another example of wearables that can be stylish and highly functional: the Evie Ring by Movano Health. This ring is all about understanding women’s health on a deeper level. It takes things like menstrual health, mood, energy levels, and more into consideration. The sleek design has a gap in it to accommodate finger size changes due to hormonal fluctuations — a thoughtful feature that highlights the attention to detail in women-centric design. These products are part of a movement that sees technology as a tool for empowerment and personalization. They represent a future where technology is accessible and attuned to the unique needs of women, enhancing their daily lives. Keynote: Walmart Embraces AI and AR Walmart’s CES Keynote made it clear they’re all-in on forward-thinking strategies like ‘Adaptive Retail’; an approach that’s not just about selling products but creating a dynamic, personalized experience. As part of their adaptive retail strategy, they’re harnessing the power of advanced AI to provide a personalized, intuitive shopping experience. Their new GenAI-Powered Search Experience is designed to not just understand what you are looking for but also why, ensuring the most relevant results. Walmart also launched their ‘Shop With Friends’ platform which combines shopping with social media by allowing shoppers to share virtual outfits with friends in real-time using AR (augmented reality). Get instant feedback from your friends on that new outfit! Beauty and Fashion Tech at CES 2024 Traditional beauty routines will soon be transformed into experiences of convenience, personalization, and high-tech elegance. L’Oreal took innovation to the next level at CES. Their lineup included the Airlight Pro, a hairdryer that uses infrared light to dry hair and preserve its moisture. They also introduced the Colorsonic, a user-friendly, brush-like hair coloring device that makes at-home hair coloring a breeze. And finally, their Beauty Genius App is an AI-supported virtual advisor that recommends skincare and makeup products tailored to individual skin types. AI-Generated Image from Dall-E 3 of Temporary Tattoo Printer at CES Moving on to something that does truly blend tech and aesthetics- the world of temporary tattoos. There were multiple temporary tattoo printers at CES 2024 like Imprintu and Prinker, which provide a painless and commitment-free way to get some body art. Photo: Nimble Last but certainly not least, let’s talk about Nimble — an AI and robotics-powered device that offers salon-worthy manicures at home. The device uses high-resolution micro cameras and 3D imaging to assess nail shape and size, followed by a robotic arm that applies polish with impeccable accuracy (yes, you read that right). The future of beauty is definitely personalized and efficient. Fashion isn’t far behind in this tech revolution. The collaboration between The Kooples and IMKI, bringing an AI-powered capsule collection, is a testament to how technology is reshaping our wardrobes. Lenovo also emphasized connectivity with The Lenovo Tab Wear Collection, developed with RANRA, Kit Wan Studios, and Maium. The collection featured garments that physically incorporate Lenovo tablets (pockets, privacy viewing hood.. etc.). Embracing 2024’s Innovations This event is always so much more than just a showcase of gadgets; it shows us how our future will (quickly) be shaped by innovation, where technology intertwines seamlessly with every part of our lives. These technologies have the potential to drastically improve the quality of our lives. I’d love to hear your thoughts on these advancements and how they might shape your world.
