 How NFTs will Affect The Fashion & Beauty Industry Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are among the newest methods of sweeping the artwork, design, and fashion and beauty industry that has evolved into a unique type of obsession. In short, some people see the value and want a piece of its potential value. NFTs are indeed the token authenticating of the original file, and this is where it modifies the idea of beauty. They don’t grant the owner anything other than possession. Rather than a product becoming the only way of connecting with a brand, NFTs allow individuals to purchase into the brand via digital collectibles, virtual products, or developing types of assets, paving the way for new, interesting, and limitless ways to connect with others and profit. Dina Fierro, the Vice President of global digital strategy and socialization of Nars, stated that “We believe that NFTs will eventually provide a deeper connection with Nars’ most valuable and passionate customers, enabling self-expression and creativity in immersive digital settings like the metaverse.” Fashion and beauty brands are dabbling with the digital token, spanning from Nars to E.l.f. Cosmetics to Givenchy Beauty, being one of the first to revolutionize how we transfer and engage with beauty. NFT’s Defined NFTs are electronic tokens that represent the unique and genuine possession of a digital or real asset or concept. It acts as a digital imprint of possession, preventing stolen, duplicated, or modified rights. These things and concepts can then be auctioned on and traded for as little or as much as they are worth on cryptocurrency marketplaces. It allows creators, companies, and artists control over their content, redefining the value of creation while eroding the barriers between inclusiveness and scarcity, private and public. Why The beauty industry is embracing it Gracie J is one of a rising variety of visual artists, brands, and public personalities who are currently selling NFTs. Gracie J minted her artwork utilizing the NFT-generating service Rarible, just like artists who have been free to sell digital works for large amounts of money (reaching millions of dollars). She is made a song called “Cut Me Dat Check” about it back in 2020.  It includes a GIF of an animated hand wearing her nail design, as well as a real element in the form of a limited-edition pair of press-on nails for the purchaser. While fashion has already jumped on the NFT bandwagon, Gracie J is one of the first in the beauty industry to do so. “The space is really wonderful. It’s awe-inspiring. It’s extremely exciting for creators since their work lives on in eternity, and they get commission on sales in perpetuity if their item sells,” Gracie J. remarked. The exorbitant selling prices of electronic collectibles have sparked far too much interest and speculation that the thrill alone may be more than enough to entice cosmetic firms to begin dabbling in NFT. “No one knows the answer, but we love being first because it allows us to define it,” Gayitri Budhraja, Elf’s VP of brand, explains. “We saw the hype and wanted to show up in a way that felt authentic to the brand and appropriate for the platform,” says the designer. Gayitri Budhraja goes on to say that it is an aspect where she will have to look into. “It’s not simply a flash…It’s not going away, but it’s getting more complicated.” How The Beauty Industry is Embracing NFT’s Already this year, cosmetic businesses have started to examine NFTs with initiatives centered on limited-edition goods and artworks. Nars, for instance, commissioned three NFT pieces by artists Sara Shakeel, Azéde Jean-Pierre, and Nina Kraviz to commemorate its hero blush Orgasm. Shakeel designed a glistening crystal lips film for Nars, complete with a surging wave in the mouth. It was the most literal representation of the item, as the lips mirror the peach and pink shade of Nars Orgasm.  According to Dina Fierro, Nars’ VP of worldwide online presence and socialization, it could make a terrific background or art for a framed TV. “This isn’t a money-making opportunity. The goal is to create a truly original and innovative experience centered on a well-known and famous product.” Dina Fierro, the brand’s vice president of global digital marketing strategy and socialization, told POPSUGAR that the goal was to produce distinctive digital works inspired by Orgasm’s sensory essence and distinctive hue. E.l.f. Cosmetics released three editions of three different NFT items, totaling nine, offered on the NFT marketplace Bitski.  Then, Givenchy Parfums collaborated with Amar Singh, a London gallerist and the Rewind artist, to auction 1,952 copies of digital artwork in favor of the LGBTQ+ nonprofit organization Le Mag Jeunes association.  What Impact Can It Potentially Make According to specialists, this new opportunity to acquire beauty, creativity, and goods will have a greater impact than we realize. “Blockchain technology combined with NFTs and cryptocurrency will completely alter the beauty business,” said Marc Beckman, the founder, and CEO of DMA United, a creative firm. “The decentralized nature of Web3 will allow a clear avenue of direct engagement between marketers and customers. When beauty firms use blockchain technology correctly, they may significantly impact two aspects of their business: trade and advertising. Truesy’s initiative with Nars, for example, allowed owners of limited-edition art pieces to gain access to physical products.” The potential downfall of fashion and beauty NFT’s Because NFTs are only intended to confer possession of an original file, it’s unclear what benefit beauty businesses will derive from this amount of digital publicity. “From a commercial standpoint, brands can create new revenue streams through primary and secondary sales of digital artwork, physical items, or live events,” Beckman explained. “Brands can have complete control over their messaging and product flow into the market without the usual disruptions caused by third-party merchants and media partners.” As a result, companies and brands will be pushed towards an infinite intelligence that can design their approach and strategy. “A brand’s physical reality does not have to mirror its metaverse reality,” he continued, “since it can reach new and younger audiences, appear differently, and be engaged in new and exciting ways.” Although NFTs are an exciting way to move the beauty industry further, it’s important to remember that they’re still relatively new and come with their own set of obstacles. For starters, NFTs are regarded as a type of cryptocurrency, which, like any economic risk, concerns are raised about secure investments, particularly long-term investments, given that a token could be worth upwards of millions of dollars in a single minute before being tossed, having lost its intrinsic worth. Since they are now reliant on visual and emotive value, their desirability and worth can be transient without any actual footing, generating anxiety for any customer purchasing them or looking to rely on them as a solid long-term investment. NFTs as a token protect ownership to the original concept, item, or artwork beyond the revenue model; however, this does not prevent the genuine piece from being reproduced and disseminated somewhere else. NFTs face security vulnerabilities in addition to the risk of duplication since hackers can gain access to the completely digitized environment. NFTs are newcomers to the beauty marketplace, and while fascinating and intriguing, they can also present issues yet to be resolved. Nonetheless, it’s evident that they’re utilizing a fresh hand in attractiveness and stumbling in front of the vast and online environment. Although not all beauty brands require an NFT approach or item to generate income, it is also a risky bet in the speculative cryptocurrency and financial worlds. You could call it an investment of sorts that is still attempting to find its footholds in the marketplace — for the beauty customer. NFT’s may have other opportunities with the metaverse of virtual and augmented reality using cryptocurrency and capitalizing off of tokenized gaming, in which meta players can shop beauty brands in Web3 and digital purchase assets for potential profit. But, until blockchain has been wholly validated for all securities, it is just a cool thing to dabble in the potential future possibilities.
