 Health And Fitness Has Failed Women  It’s an unfortunate and ugly truth: most women know what it’s like to be on a diet (only to quickly abandon it soon after starting because it was too strict), to hate how her body looks in a swimsuit, and to measure her self-worth by the number on the bathroom scale. Whether you’re glancing at magazines in the checkout line at the grocery or scrolling through your social media feeds, you see it: headlines and images that promote what a healthy body looks like and how “you can finally achieve it too!” Just take these supplements, drink those shakes, follow these quick-fix tips, or try the latest celebrity-endorsed workout program and you’ll finally love your body. But here’s the thing: much of what’s promoted as health and fitness is bullshit. Here’s some of the popular ideology in the health and fitness world that’s failing women. Eat like her — look like her! You can’t flip through a magazine without seeing the latest celebrity weight loss story and the diet she used to achieve those jaw-dropping results in only a couple weeks. (“Just had a baby? So did she, and she got her pre-baby body back in only a few weeks!”) Likewise, health and fitness magazines outline the meal plan of top figure athletes. We’re led to believe that if we eat like these women that we can achieve the same amazing results … but this is nonsense. Another woman’s body is not your measuring stick — be it a celebrity, figure competitor, athlete, or Instagram star — don’t strive to “look like her.” Unless you have the same genetics and regimen as another woman, you won’t look like her. Period. Seeing what someone ate for a few weeks accompanied with a picture of their “after” body doesn’t mean you’ll achieve the same results. Oftentimes, these women have been working out and eating well for many, many years. We’re seeing the end result of years of training and eating well (and, not to mention, a hefty dose of photo-editing). Committing to the most recent celebrity-endorsed diet won’t leave you looking like her after a few months. (For the measurements you should track, click the link in the above paragraph.) Deprivation is mandatory. Because of the myriad fad diets that circulate, we’re led to believe that deprivation is just part of the process; to lose weight or change the appearance of your body, you’re going to have to suffer. You’ll inevitably have a long list of do-not-eat foods and entire food groups to avoid with many fad diets, so you think misery is part of the process. For most people (i.e., not professional competitors who must have incredibly low levels of body fat) who want to feel great and look better, the strict, rigid rules you see are not mandatory. You do not have to deprive yourself or suffer to improve your health and change your body. Anything goes! This is on the opposite end of the spectrum of the point above. Some fitness experts proclaim deprivation is mandatory and that misery is a badge of honor (those who suffer can proclaim to be “hardcore”). On the other end is the group that says anything goes, and this is equally wrong. Just as you don’t have to deprive yourself every day to lose weight or improve your health, anyone telling you not to make conscious choices is doing a great disservice. While you don’t have to be an obsessive zealot with your eating choices, you do have to take responsibility for your eating habits and make smart (albeit obsessive-free) eating decisions consistently. Put in simpler terms: you can enjoy things like ice cream or your other favorite not-so-healthy foods on occasion, but you can’t expect to eat them every day with reckless abandon without negative consequences. Both extremes, in this case, are wrong. Go hard or go home. Many popular programs reinforce the idea that achieving high levels of fatigue with each workout is what matters most; as long as you feel completely drained at the end of every workout, you did well. Fatigue is not an indicator of a successful workout. Pounding yourself to the point where you’re chronically sore and exhausted is not productive, nor safe. In fact, especially when it comes to strength training, you should finish your workouts feeling empowering, not exhausted. This is one of the beautiful things about strength training: improving your performance gradually is what matters most, and you needn’t be brutally sore to achieve this goal (more on this below). You ate it, now negate it! Exercise is not punishment for eating. This “Earn your food!” and “You better go burn off that dessert!” mentality is harmful, and stupid. Fat loss has to be your goal. How many headlines have you seen that didn’t have something to do with losing weight, getting a smaller waist line, or fixing a “flaw”? According to many magazines and websites the only goal women can have is fat loss. Now, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to lose weight, but it doesn’t have to be your goal, even if you need to lose weight for health reasons. This shouldn’t be revolutionary, but it is: you can have a goal other than obtaining a smaller number on the scale. If you’ve been on more diets than you can recall or the only reason you work out or eat well is to lose fat, then please try this: focus on improving the things your body can do, and then do more. What’s The Right Answer? If the points above highlight how health and fitness has failed women, what should you do? First and foremost, if you want to improve your health and fitness, you must adopt sustainable habits. Put simply: if the routine you’re planning to employ isn’t something you’ll be able to do one year from now, don’t do it. Ask yourself: is this workout program something I’ll still be able to do one year from now? If you’re a busy woman and you’re contemplating whether or not to do the latest 12 week workout program that requires you to spend five days at the gym, then the answer is no. If, however, you’re considering a strength training program that consists of three total body workouts per week, then the answer will likely be yes. Here are a few additional guidelines your health and fitness actions should meet: They should empower you and make you feel better about yourself. They should ultimately reduce your stress, and not add to it. They must meet the three S’s: Simple, Sustainable, Sane. (Simple: do I understand what I must do to achieve results? Sustainable: can I do this one year from now? Sane: is this free from obsessive or self-destructive guidelines?) They must be about your journey and not reaching the standards or ideals of someone else. If you don’t know where to start, you can’t go wrong with the basics. And if you’ve been working out for several years but feeling burned out or have lost all motivation to continue, revert back to the basics too. When it comes to strength training, focus on the big, basic exercises and commit to getting stronger, slowly and steadily. For nutrition, track everything you eat for at least a month and see where you can make small improvements. Make one at a time and do that one thing every single day for a month, then make another small change, and repeat. Sound too simple? Good. Most diets and workout plans fail because they’re too complicated. Hammer the basics, master them, and you’ll achieve results, and sustain them long-term. Despite what you see in the latest attention-grabbing headline, improving your health and changing your body isn’t complicated. Like what you read?
