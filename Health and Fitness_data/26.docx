 Health and Fitness: Top 100 Influencers and Brands  Health and fitness bloggers took social media by storm in 2015, writing about fitness plans, workout routines, alternative diets and of course the increasingly popular phenomenon of avocado on toast! It is easier than ever to share and create content through a multitude of online media platforms, so these bloggers have become celebrities in themselves, acting as ambassadors for big food brands. Some have even secured best-seller book deals and featured in consumer lifestyle magazines. WHAT ARE THE EXPERTS SAYING? We wanted to reach out to some of the top influencers to ask them for their views on Health and Fitness, so we spoke to Obi Obadike (#1) and Krista Styker (#10). Be sure to follow them to stay up to date on the best content and resources on Health and Fitness! (click on the names to see their Twitter profiles)  Obi Obadike — “Exercise and Diet are both equally important in regards to weight loss vs weight gain. Our overall health in our society will always be revolved around what we eat and how much physical exercise we do. Those two things should never be taken for granted because without making that a priority in your life as you age you will face health issues and shorten your life. If you value your life you will never neglect those two important things. Exercise used to be one of those optional things that a doctor would advise patients to do and now it is mandatory prescription. You have one life so don’t do anything to waste it or shorten it. Exercise and eating healthy is a lifestyle and it should be looked as your personal hygiene like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.”  Krista Stryker — “Working towards a fitness goal rather than a weight loss one is much, much more motivating in the long run. Even if your short-term goal is to lose weight, setting and working towards fitness and athletic goals is a much more motivating way to get and stay fit in the long run. Whether you make it a goal to do your first handstand, finally be able to do a front split, or even to rock your first half marathon, the best kind of goal to make is something that you’ve always wanted to be able to do.” MAPPING THE HEALTH AND FITNESS COMMUNITY We were keen to analyse the health and fitness discussion to identify which influencers were driving the most engagement on social media. We analysed over 2M tweets around the following query: “fitness AND (health OR diet OR nutrition OR wellbeing OR protein OR supplements OR exercise OR workout)” and identified the top 100 most influential brands and individuals leading the discussion on Twitter. We discovered a very engaged community, with much discussion between individuals and brands, joining together in conversations around health and fitness.

The brands and individuals listed are undoubtedly influential when it comes to driving discussion around health and fitness. The PageRank based methodology we use to extract influencers on a particular topic takes into account the number and quality of contextual references that a user receives. These calculations are independent of a user’s number of followers, but we do filter our lists based on how much a user is engaged in the conversation and the influence they drive through their networks.
