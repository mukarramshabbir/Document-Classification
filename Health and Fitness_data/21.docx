 10 Health and Fitness Infographics That You Need To See And I saved the best for last 1. The Effects of Excessive Sodium Intake  Salt is the most commonly overlooked nutrient in our diet. People are so worried about the dangers of excessive amounts of carbs, fat, sugar, and cholesterol that we ignore how prevalent sodium is in our foods — from breads, to frozen meals, to deli meats, and beyond. Sodium can lead to big problems if we don’t manage it. 2. Hidden Sugars  We don’t expect sugar to be hiding in salad dressings or our bread and we also underestimate just how much sugar is in the food we expect to be sugary. While this is by no means an all-inclusive list, this infographic gives you perspective on sugar and how often it is used in the food industry. 3. Excessive Sugar Intake  Can’t have salty without sweet. Sugar, unlike sodium, is a well known health hazard that we’re all on the lookout for. The problem is that we simply like it too much. On top of our tongue’s desire for sweet treats, our bodies have an innate need for sweets so it’s biological just as much as it is choice. We must be more aware of how much sugar we’re actually getting because, just like sodium, sugar hides in many places so we tend to underestimate just how much we get. 4. Health and Fitness Guide for Students  There’s a lot of college students who are under constant pressure from every angle — school, work, family, friends, internal pressures and anxiety, etc. Health is often overlooked for these things, but it should be prioritized alongside them. 5. Exercise for Newbies  New exercisers go into the gym with high hopes and little structure. They feel good after working out, but they don’t see the results they want because they lack some structure along with basic understanding of exercise. Here’s an infographic that covers some of the basics. 6. Natural Health Tips  Want to eat better, but don’t know how? Here’s an infographic that lays out important needs for different parts of the body so you can start planning your next grocery store visit and meal. 7. Building a Well Rounded Meal Plate  The last graphic told you what the body needs. This one builds off that by giving you a good idea of what your meal plate should consist of. 8. Fitness Myths  There’s a lot of misinformation floating around out there about health and fitness. It’s still surprises me how many people believe these, and other, myths. 9. It’s Not Just One Small Slice — Calories In Your Dessert  Sometimes we rationalize what we eat by claiming it’s “just one small piece”, but that doesn't make the calories, fat, and, carbs disappear. Don’t underestimate the dessert tray. Think twice before you decide to splurge. 10. The Ultimate Workout Nutrition Guide  This is my favorite. Workout nutrition is so important and this graphic does an excellent job of displaying just that. It covers the pre- and post-workout meals while giving practical suggestions on what to eat and why you should eat it and when you should eat it. It also covers the difference between cardio and strength training nutrition needs. The reason why I love this graphic so much is because it does such a great job of educating you not only on the what, but also the why and the how. It’s easy to tell someone not to do something or avoid this food, but giving practical suggestions on what to do and how to do it is key in correcting bad behaviors and becoming a better decision maker on food and getting the most out of your workout.
