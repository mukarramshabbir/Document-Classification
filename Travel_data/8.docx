 Travel and Personal Growth: Author Margaret Sullivan On Why & How Traveling Can Help Us Become Better Human Beings  Keep the peace. We’re all familiar with post-trip blues — that specific hangover you get when it’s time to head back to reality. One of the greatest skills we’ve honed is the ability to bottle the peace and relaxation we enjoy when traveling and bring it home into our everyday lives, even today, when we can only travel during school breaks and still return to New York City, a place most associate with the rat race. We actively resist sliding back into any stress or hectic state. We prioritize time with family and friends; we get outdoors and exercise; we schedule downtime together. Whenever we can, we turn up the music, open the windows and toast being together while we still have the chance. Thankfully, the world is open for travel once again. Traveling can broaden our horizons and make space for people to become more open-minded. How can travel give us the opportunity for personal growth? What are some ways that travel can help us become better human beings? As a part of our series about “How Traveling Can Help Us Become Better Human Beings”, I had the pleasure of interviewing Margaret Bensfield Sullivan. Margaret Bensfield Sullivan is the author of Following the Sun: Tales (and Fails) From a Year Around the World With Our Kids (2023), which describes the year she and her husband quit their jobs, took their young children out of school, gave up their New York City home, and left the U.S. to travel around the world, visiting 29 countries across six continents. Margaret spent nearly two decades in brand marketing before her big adventure. She was a partner at WPP’s marketing agency Group SJR, where she designed storytelling campaigns on behalf of clients like TED, Target, Disney, and USAID. Today she is a writer and illustrator living in New York City. Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive into the main focus of our interview, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your childhood backstory? I’m from Northwest Washington, DC, the third of four kids — lawyer dad, photographer mom, a succession of rescue dogs to complete the picture. If there’d been a banner strung over our house, it might have read, “We prioritize education and travel!” That was the mantra our parents always repeated, at least. They pushed us to be avid readers and filled weekends with trips downtown to DC’s many free museums. On school breaks we’d head out of town to discover places like California, Montana, New Mexico, New York, and Tennessee. When we begged for video game consoles or brand-name clothing, they’d just point to the banner. I can see now how some of these childhood trips directly shaped my future. The Manhattan of our annual 1980s and 90s visits — the limos, the chestnut carts, the honking! — had me under a spell that would eventually lure me to move there. A family trip to France cemented my future as a French speaker after my mother fell in love with the language and decided I needed to learn it. She forced me to take the classes and do the exchanges and by the time I graduated from high school, lo and behold, I was fluent. I wound up moving to France for three years after college to teach. What or who inspired you to pursue your career? We’d love to hear the story. I had a very successful two decades in brand marketing, but I’m not sure there was a moment or a person who inspired me to pursue that path — mostly because I can’t say I ever was “inspired” to pursue a career in marketing at all. Like most people, I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up! I just took the first job in New York I could get, which happened to be in marketing, and climbed the ranks until one day I was in charge. Not that I have regrets. Those years amounted to one huge lesson in leadership, creativity and Getting Things Done. I met lifelong friends and brilliant people. Best of all, and proof that life is unpredictable, it was this career in marketing that led me to a fateful 2017 work trip to Tanzania. An epiphany there — the world is big and our time is short — inspired my wild idea to quit our jobs and travel around the world as a family. None of us can achieve success without some help along the way. Was there a particular person who you feel gave you the most help or encouragement to be who you are today? Can you share a story about that? My parents instilled morals and a desire to see the world; smart bosses along the way taught me how to deliver; but I have to credit my husband with supplying bottomless encouragement. His belief in my skills always seems to outweigh my own, providing the perfect antidote to imposter syndrome and self-doubt. He’s been my loudest cheerleader and most unapologetic “hype man,” on everything from comp negotiations to writing a first book. Everyone should have someone so deeply in their corner. It has been said that sometimes our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share the funniest or most interesting mistake that occurred to you in the course of your career? What lesson or takeaway did you learn from that? There may be too many to list! In fact, when I first started out, I would watch “The Apprentice” religiously because seeing other people get yelled at for their rookie work mistakes made me feel better about my own. Today I can see how all my early blunders, each of which felt like the absolute end of the world in the moment, accumulated over time to become hard-earned wisdom I’m so proud to have today. Can you share your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Why does that resonate with you so much? One of my favorite and longtime clients was TED, as in TED Conferences. In 2018, I heard an interview between the head of TED, Chris Anderson, and the Muslim studies scholar Dalia Mogahed. It was a wide-ranging and profound conversation worthy of a listen, but there was one line in particular that resonated with me. When asked how she explains the existence of god when there is so much suffering in the world, Mogahed replied, “…we were never promised paradise on earth. We were only promised a human experience…” This line stopped me in my tracks. Not because I’m religious (I’m not), but because it reset the record: I am entitled to nothing. A smooth and happy life is not a guarantee. The human experience includes hardship and pain — from toddler meltdowns to actual tragedy — the same as it does joy. Ever since I heard her description, I always confront tough situations from the same starting point: “This is a human experience.” What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now? How do you think that might help people? I’m proud to have recently published an illustration in an important new revisionist history, “Plentiful Country: The Great Potato Famine and the Making of Irish New York” (Little, Brown, 2024) by award-winning author Tyler Anbinder. It was an especially fun challenge for someone who loves history because I was tasked with creating an image in the style of the period, a mid-1800s engraved political cartoon, while still finding a way to emphasize the author’s main argument. My hope is that the book, with a little help from my illustration, of course, offers readers an extraordinary new understanding of this old history. OK, thank you for all of that. Let’s now shift to the core focus of our interview about travel and personal growth. Let’s dive deeper into these together. Based on your research or personal experience, why do you think travel can lead to personal growth? Can you share a story? There are so many, but I’ll go with this one: Travel teaches us to be less afraid. When my family’s travel year got underway, my husband and I were fretful about safety. I stressed over dangers like….a seesaw at a Chilean playground. Thankfully we lightened up, quick. Soon we were swimming in the Amazon River, eating grilled silkworms off a Cambodian street cart and getting charged by wild elephants in Zimbabwe. The kids rode on the back of motorbikes and in the cargo beds of pickups across Asia. I lost track of the number of budget airliners and single-engine bush planes we took. Turns out we were tougher than we’d thought and capable of more than we’d given ourselves credit for. More importantly, we saw that we weren’t in the line of fire just because we were abroad. Not any more so than we were at home, that is. Everywhere can be dangerous — with scary weather episodes and explosive politics; the lurking danger of illness and the existential danger of climate change. Cities we visited like Bogota and Kingston and Johannesburg might have had “perilous” reputations, but what about life’s garden variety dangers? Like driving or walking? Or just being alive? Travel made us appreciate how we are both safe and vulnerable — no matter where we go. A recent survey from Psychology Today showed that over 80% of participants found that travel helped them with problem-solving or decision-making. Why do you think this is true for so many people? It is so true. I think Albert Einstein is the one credited with saying, “No worthy problem is ever solved within the plane of its original conception.” Travel provides an off-ramp from the treadmill, the bubble, the “plane of original conception” — whatever you want to call it — to take us to places where we can approach old problems with fresh perspectives. Travel can also be extremely clarifying. By month eight of our travel year, my husband and I were moved to draw up a list of six Sullivan Family Priorities — core criteria we felt were necessary to create the life we wanted to live when we got home. Such clarity! Today that list still informs all the decisions we make and keeps the noise and nonsense from creeping back in. I like to say creating it was the emotional equivalent of laying my arm on a cluttered table and pushing everything off in one large sweep. Nothing broken, nothing to clean up, just a way to proceed undistracted by mess. We couldn’t have distilled it down so clearly without time spent on a different plane. Do you think travel enhances our mindfulness, optimism, or sense of gratitude? How? Can you please explain with an example or story? I love how travel gives people the power to slow time. When folks assume our travel year flew by, they’re always surprised to learn that it did not. It actually plodded along at a satisfying pace. Even in hindsight, years later, it seems epic, not fleeting. And I think there’s a lesson there. Every day that we traveled required navigating new streets, figuring out new protocols, calculating unfamiliar currencies, seeing, smelling, tasting, and processing things we’d never encountered before. All that newness forced us to be acutely aware of every passing minute in a way we hadn’t been back when every day held the same conveyor belt of commute, work, bed. How many Mondays through Fridays had I sleepwalked to my office and been unable to recall the subway ride? Years can be the same way. How many times have people posted photos from a child’s birthday or graduation to social media with captions like, “And just like that, so-and-so is ten?” According to the scientists and philosophers who study this kind of thing, an auto-pilot routine can make life seem short, whereas memories, when accumulated, stack up to make life feel fuller. Because we usually only remember the things that stand out from the ordinary — a vacation, a celebration, even a funeral or illness — the more of these there are (ideally not the funerals and illness), the richer and longer one’s life seems in retrospect. You don’t even have to travel, by the way, to make this work. An act as small as taking a different route for your commute or strolling a new neighborhood or saying yes to an invitation can turn off the auto-pilot switch, jolting you back to the present and creating memories for the future. Surely not everyone who travels automatically becomes an exemplar of human decency. What are a few reasons why some people completely miss out on the growth opportunities that travel can offer? I can think of two almost immediately. The first is social media. When we arrived at 7 a.m. to hike the Tegalalang rice paddies in Ubud, Bali, an elaborate system of ancient, cascading rice terraces of bright green, we were surprised to see dozens of men and women dressed for photo shoots, with full faces of TV-ready hair, makeup and wardrobe. I remember this one bewildered farmer resting on a hoe, watching a pair of girlfriends taking turns snapping photos of each other twirling in outfits pulled from a rolling suitcase, right there in the rice paddy. Social media drives these people to travel for what appears to be the sole purpose of juicing their social media likes. They may come home with glamorous photos, but I’m pretty sure that’s it. The second is “responsible tourism,” a label I now treat with extreme caution and put in quotes because it’s so frequently applied to activities that are actually quite irresponsible. Specifically, so-called “voluntourism” or tourism that “gives back,” aka well-intentioned experiences that make wealthy tourists feel good about themselves, but actually do damage. Think traveling to a poor country and digging a well in a village, delivering supplies to a local school, or — the worst possible — visiting an orphanage. Tourists may get a thrill from feeling like a savior, but experts say this trend is exploitative and unhelpful. Not only does voluntourism perpetuate dependency on aid, it can cement harmful stereotypes. Plus, cycling through an endless revolving door of short-term “helpers” isn’t psychologically healthy for any community, especially children. Anyone who wants to be responsible when they travel should stick to these simple rules: Respect the people. Not by treating them as tourist destinations or charity cases or by taking their photos, but by asking curious questions about their culture and developing personal connections, even friendships. Respect the place. Clean up after yourself and, more importantly, leave nature as is. Admire the shells, rocks and feathers — but don’t take them with you.  What are your “5 Habits You Should Develop In Order Make Travel Into An Opportunity For Personal Growth?” 1. Suspend judgment. It can be hard, but when traveling, accept that you don’t know what you don’t know, and assume a posture of deference. You’re in someone else’s hometown. When you embrace an I’m-new-here earnestness and start to observe and listen, you’ll more clearly see the beauty in unfamiliar customs, foods and beliefs — rather than get hung up on the way things “should” be or how this new place compares to your way of life. That kind of bias is exhausting (for everyone). As the ancient Greek Stoic Marcus Aurelius put it, “These things are not asking to be judged by you.” 2. Befriend strangers. Before our big year of travel, we weren’t the types to talk to people on the bus or chat up shopkeepers. But once we made a conscious decision to shelve our homebody instincts and start meeting people, we discovered how doing so could lead to, well, you never knew what it could lead to, which was the point. When a laundromat owner in Stockholm said to try her favorite neighborhood restaurant, we went. When a gas station attendant in Tasmania insisted we see this one waterfall, or when someone in Bali suggested a surf film festival in town, we went. We always said yes. Not only could we learn more about a place from these exchanges than from any organized tour, strangers offered our best shot at getting off the beaten path. 3. Write it down. The sheer volume of information and content that flooded our travel days — photos, hotel reservations, inspired “a-ha” moments that struck while we were staring up at the Pyramids — was enough to overwhelm even the most organized archivist. We worried everything coming in would quickly evaporate back out if we didn’t trap it in real time. We devised a pretty sophisticated system of documentation to house it all: a daily journal, photos and videos sorted and tagged, music playlists, rankings, quotes, inside jokes, lists of patterns we observed, and much, much more. It became a kind of “second brain,” to use the term coined by digital productivity pioneer Tiago Forte. Today it makes up a deep well of treasure we can easily dip into for trip details, yes, but also ideas and inspiration for future use. 4. Ditch the baggage. I mean this both literally and figuratively. When it came to packing, we figured a trip around the world would be hard enough without the burden of huge suitcases and opted for one carry-on suitcase and one backpack per person. We came to love the feeling of weightlessness. Today we not only pack light when we travel, we also consume less, sign up for less, and only take it on or buy it if it’s truly worthy of “carrying.” Our freedom from unnecessary distractions and stuff is like an infomercial: The black and white “before” depiction shows our family groaning under the weight of heavy suitcases and laptop bags, shaking our fists at jobs, obligations, and schedules, while the color “after” clip has us strolling along, laughing, swinging just a few tiny bags, light as air, with no clutter to weigh us down. 5. Keep the peace. We’re all familiar with post-trip blues — that specific hangover you get when it’s time to head back to reality. One of the greatest skills we’ve honed is the ability to bottle the peace and relaxation we enjoy when traveling and bring it home into our everyday lives, even today, when we can only travel during school breaks and still return to New York City, a place most associate with the rat race. We actively resist sliding back into any stress or hectic state. We prioritize time with family and friends; we get outdoors and exercise; we schedule downtime together. Whenever we can, we turn up the music, open the windows and toast being together while we still have the chance. From your experience, does travel have a negative impact on personal growth too? Is there a downside to travel? About ten months into our year of non-stop travel, we weren’t tired, as many people thought we might be, but we did face another challenge. I’ll never forget sitting at our house rental in Far North Queensland, Australia, trying to work up the excitement to put down our books and head out for a once-in-a-lifetime day of snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef. We had already snorkeled so much that year — would this really be that much better? We had grown spoiled. Or desensitized, maybe. Travel writer Bill Bryson summed it up when he said, “Which was worse, to lead a life so boring that you are easily enchanted, or a life so full of stimulus that you are easily bored.” (We went, by the way, and it was spectacular.) We are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US, whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we both tag them :-) I’m such a huge fan of Wall Street Journal travel editor Sebastian Modak. In 2019, he was picked to be The New York Times’ “52 Places” writer, which meant he got sent on assignment to 52 places around the world — one per week — covering far-flung destinations the paper considered worthy of highlighting for readers. He’s got such wisdom and a lovely, humorous way of observing the world. Because he traveled the world the same year we did and we followed his adventures via social media and the occasional Times dispatch, he feels like a friend. My husband and I would love to sit down and compare notes over a beer one day. How can our readers further follow your work online?
