SUBSCRIBE TO THIS ACCOUNT  Carry-On vs. Checked Bags Deciding where to pack your adult toys — carry-on luggage or checked bags — is the main choice to be made while packing. Here are the pros and cons of each to help you make an informed choice. Carry-On Luggage: Pros and Cons Carrying adult toys in your carry-on baggage might seem like a great idea due to the reduced risk of loss and immediate access. However, it also means your items will go through the TSA security screening, possibly leading to a bag inspection. To minimize potential embarrassment, consider packing your adult toys in a dedicated bag for easy identification, reducing the need for security guards to handle them directly.

Expensive sex toys or your favorite vibrator might be safer on your person despite the potential for a security check. In both cases, using a travel lock function or removing batteries can prevent your sex toys from accidentally turning on, avoiding embarrassing situations and ensuring a peaceful journey. International Flights: Navigating Global Norms  Traveling internationally with sex toys introduces a new layer of complexity due to diverse legal landscapes. Each country’s stance on personal adult toys can vary significantly, affecting your travel experience.

Countries like Maldives and Vietnam have stringent regulations, where possession of adult toys might lead to legal troubles.
