 Travel stories: First hours in Bangkok, Thailand  Sitting in the Chiang Mai airport, waiting for my flight to Bangkok. The voice and language spoken by the announcer on the PA system sound like the robot nurses/doctors in the Star Wars movie before “A New Hope” (Clone Wars?), delivering Luke and Princess Leia. Lol! In Bangkok, it seems I got directions from the wrong airport! No train available from this one. My options were a taxi for 890 baht or a bus and metro for about 100 baht, potentially arriving 30 minutes later than the taxi. Since it’s only 2 pm, I’m going for the adventure. So far, it’s been quite an experience. Boarding the bus turned into a bit of a rugby scrum as the orderly line disintegrated. I managed to block a guy trying to cut in on my right and hip-checked a lady trying to slip in on my left, securing myself a seat. The bus ride is an hour long on the highway, not the most comfortable trip to be standing for. The last stop connects to the metro line, and from there, I’ll take the sky train, an elevated train that encircles Bangkok. You might remember the sky train from my French friend’s unusual Thai social class classification. Bangkok looks completely different from Phuket and Chiang Mai. It’s much larger and more sprawling, with full-size gas stations — quite a contrast to the whisky-bottle-filled booths in Phuket. There are plenty of proper high-rises, making the city look quite modern. They seem to be adding another level of elevated highways as well. I’m even seeing full-on skyscrapers; didn’t see those in Chiang Mai. You could probably fit Patong’s population in one of those towers. There aren’t as many temples here; I think I’ve only seen one. In Chiang Mai, there’s a temple every few feet — I’ve got temple fatigue. The bus made an unexpected stop, and people with luggage looked confused and slightly panicked as we tried to figure out if it was our stop. Whispers of concern spread through the bus like an emotional wave. The bus started again. Where were we going? How long would it take? When would we know we had arrived? We stopped again, and half the passengers got off, causing more confusion. I asked the bus clerk, and it seems this is the stop. Turns out, I went to the wrong station — I went to the metro instead of the sky train. Every metro and mall entrance has bag checks, so security is tight here. Even at the airport, you’re pre-screened before entering, then screened again before heading to the gate or immigration, and yet again on the plane ramp. Serious business. Bangkok is cooler than Chiang Mai, but there’s a damp scent here that’s making me feel nauseous. It hit me as soon as I got off the plane and a few times while walking from the train to my hotel. Could I be pregnant? Did something happen while I was asleep during one of my massages? The portraits of the King here are more modern and artistic compared to the traditional royal attire seen in Phuket and Chiang Mai. He’s depicted in a suit, and I haven’t seen any images of him with his wife yet. OMG, I think I’m in the shopping mall capital of the world! Everywhere I look, there are massive multi-story shopping mall complexes. How many LV and Chanel stores can one city have? They’re blasting techno music at rave volume, and I’m the only one dancing. I now understand my French friend’s reference to the “sky people” of Bangkok living and travelling high above the streets. The elevated walkways are a few stories above the street, lined with green foliage, shimmering malls, and loud techno music. Looking down at the street below, it’s quite a post-apocalyptic scene. It reminds me of Tokyo down there, but with fewer horns and people. The sidewalks don’t seem as stained, and while there’s no rubbish around, the ground looks dirty. This city has a very unique look — that Blade Runner-esque feel that many Asian capitals have, with an incongruent mix of old, futuristic, and fluorescent. I like this room and the hotel area. There’s a night market right outside with lots of BBQ options. The room is nice, though it’s the smallest I’ve had so far. Up until now, I’ve had California king and larger beds, as well as junior suite and suite-sized rooms. This bed is a double, but I’m really enjoying the Japanese toilet. I don’t need a heated seat, but it would be nice if the seat was chilled to a comfortable 7 degrees. I’ll set the air con to 18 and warm up the toilet seat. This room with this lovely bathroom is only $27.00 per nigh.  There’s a body-on-body massage place next to the hotel, actually a couple of them. I’m assuming that’s more than just a standard massage scenario — lol. It’s the first time I’ve seen that advertised on this trip. I’ve read about them but hadn’t come across one until now.  Unless you’re looking for something extra, don’t order an oil massage in Bangkok. Sigh! I will be processing that experience for sometime I think. I have a story about that experience on Medium.  After a rather unsettling experience this afternoon, I decided to seek refuge in a children’s movie and headed to one of the numerous super malls here. This particular mall has an airport theme and is called Terminal 21. My hotel recommended it for dining, but it’s not the best choice for Westerners looking for authentic Thai food. Each floor is themed after a major city, and they even have a large replica of the Bay Bridge on the California/San Francisco floor. I went to see “The Jungle Book.” Before the movie starts, you have to stand up and pay respects to the king. I’m not sure if the song is about the King or if it’s the national anthem. I’ll stop my observation there, as it’s a crime to speak against or criticize the royal family in Thailand. I was quite tense throughout the movie. Oh, did I mention the movie? It was “The Jungle Book.” Not a kids’ movie if you want the kid to sleep again — lol! Some pretty intense scenes, and the kid in the movie looks like a young Jian Ghomeshi. Movies and theatre experiences in Thailand are incredibly cheap. It only cost $3.62 to see the enhanced sound version of the movie. Better than any theatre we have in Canada. The weather here continues to be amazing. When I was in Canada, the forecast for Bangkok was rain every day, but it hasn’t rained since I’ve been here. I found a restaurant that serves Neapolitan pizza (shh, don’t tell anyone I ate pizza in Thailand). It was in the most luxurious-looking mall I’ve ever seen outside of Southern California. The restaurant had both indoor and outdoor seating. I chose a table in full sun, and the manager came over to ask if I wanted to move to a shaded table. I insisted that this table was perfect, despite his attempts to suggest a cooler spot with misting machines. I explained that I’m from Canada where it’s still winter and very cold. He laughed and said, “So you want maximum sun?” Exactly! He patted me on the shoulder and left. This place had one of the most interesting-looking pizzas I’ve ever seen — a whole lobster on the pizza! Lol. I didn’t order it; even I have to stick to some pizza conventions.
